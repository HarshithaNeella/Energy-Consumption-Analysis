**Energy Concusmption Analysis**

## 🚀 Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing global energy trends using structured datasets containing information on energy consumption, production, carbon emissions, GDP, and population across multiple countries and years.
The entire analysis was performed using SQL, with optimized queries that reveal insights into global sustainability, resource usage, and environmental impact.

📌 Project Objectives

✔ Analyze how countries produce and consume energy
✔ Compare emissions across regions over time
✔ Study the relation between GDP, population & energy usage
✔ Identify sustainability trends and fuel dependency patterns

📂 Dataset Overview
Table	Contains
Consumption	Year-wise country energy consumption
Production	Energy generated by each country
Emission	CO₂ & greenhouse gas emission records
Population	Population of each country
GDP	GDP (Economic growth indicator)
Country	Country metadata for mapping all tables

🔍 SQL Analytics Performed

  📊 Key Insights

📍 India & China lead in global energy demand driven by massive population

📍 Coal & oil remain dominant contributors to emissions

📍 Renewable energy adoption is growing but still secondary

📍 Some countries produce more energy than they consume

📍 Countries with rising GDP also show increased energy use and CO₂ output
